## Path Finding Visualizer
Welcome to our Path Finding Visualizer React application! This application is designed to provide a visual representation of various pathfinding algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm.
It allows users to understand how these algorithms work and how they are applied in real-world scenarios.

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm lets us prioritize which paths to explore. Instead of exploring all possible paths equally, it favors lower cost paths.
We can assign lower cost to encourage moving on roads while assigning high cost on highway to avoid them.
It is the algorithm of choice for finding the shortest path paths with multiple destinations.
